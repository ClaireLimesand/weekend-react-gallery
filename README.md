# React Gallery

## Description

Duration: weekend sprint

This photo gallery is my first project made using React. A user can click on a photo to view it's description, or click the "Like It!" button. The number of Likes will be diplayed on the DOM underneath the photo. Using react and components for the fist time was a challenge but I learned so much making this little photo gallery!
